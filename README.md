# Notice

This repository are not meant to be used by a user, but as a "blueprint" that developers
can build upon, to make more awesome stuff.

HAVE FUN! ðŸ˜Ž

## Why?

This is simple, by having... #todo

## What?

This repository contains multiple files, here is a overview:

File | Purpose
-- | --
`...` | #todo

## How?

* â€¦or create a new repository on the command line:
    ```bash
    # Initialize your new origin repository
    git init
    git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_NEW_REPOSITORY

    # Apply blueprint repository
    git remote add blueprint https://github.com/Limych/py-blueprint.git
    git fetch blueprint dev
    git reset --hard blueprint/dev
    git branch -M dev

    # Push changes to origin repository
    git push -u origin dev
    ```

* â€¦or apply blueprint to an existing repository from the command line:
    ```bash
    # Apply blueprint repository
    git remote add blueprint https://github.com/Limych/py-blueprint.git
    git fetch blueprint dev
    git merge blueprint/dev --allow-unrelated-histories

    # Push changes to origin repository
    git push -u origin dev
    ```

After these steps, your repository will developing on a own branch. But in parallel there will be this blueprint repository, new changes in which you can always apply with a couple of simple commands:
```bash
./bin/update
git merge blueprint/dev
```

**Note:** Please, before starting to develop your own code, initialize the development environment with the command
```bash
./bin/setup
```
